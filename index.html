                <p class="bio-text"> I am a self-taught developer looking for a junior dev role to hone and improve on the skills I have already learned. My ambition is to become a Full Stack Web Developer, preferably working with the MEAN/MERN stack. <br><br> I began coding in February 2017 when a couple of developer friends suggested I should try it out as I had expressed that I felt unchallenged and underwhelmed at my current job. Initially I didn't think I had what it took to become a developer.. it was a <strong>WHOLE</strong> new world to me! However I persevered, working sporadically in my free time outside of my job doing Code Academy tutorials, Udemy lectures and watching Youtube videos. The more knowledge I gained, the more excited I became about the prospect of being a developer.<br><br>During the summer I felt as though my progress had somewhat plateaued, I was not able to dedicate as much time to coding as I wanted to due to an increased workload, holidays and other extraneous factors. Thus in September I decided to resign from my job and retreat to my birthplace of Serbia where I would spend the next three months dedicating all my time and energy to coding. During this period I vastly improved my understanding of several front- and back-end programming languages, libraries and frameworks. I was able to use the knowledge I had gained to create a few unique projects that you can check out below by clicking on the image!</p>
